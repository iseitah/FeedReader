# Testing (Feed Reader)

It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project left with an incomplete test suite with Jasmine Testing.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How to run?

You can see all feeds in index.html. You can find Jasmin testing results at the bottom of the page.

### You Can visit the index.html page by [clicking here].


##Testing parts:
1- Sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
2- Ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
3- Ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
4- ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
5- ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
